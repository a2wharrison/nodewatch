# DxKit - Erlang/OTP Diagnostic Toolkit.

*DxKit* is a diagnostic toolkit for Erlang/OTP applications, utilising a wide 
range of built in (OTP) and free open source frameworks to provide discovery,
monitoring and profiling capabilities. *DxKit* is one of the components that 
makes up the [Nodewatch](http://github.com/hyperthunk/nodewatch) project. 

## *IMPORTANT NOTE*

This repository is synchronised into the main projects repository using git 
subtree merging (read about it [here](http://progit.org/book/ch6-7.html)). You
should refer to the [Nodewatch](http://github.com/hyperthunk/nodewatch) for
